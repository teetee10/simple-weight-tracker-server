Implement a simple weight-tracker app.

This test requires you to write code for NodeJS and Flutter
NodeJS: Write something using Express using NodeJS to create an API that has the following endpoints:
/login
/sign_up
/save_weight
/get_weight_history

Bonus features:
/update_weight - edit an existing weight entry
/delete_weight - delete an entry

JWT Web tokens (use npm package 'jsonwebtoken') to allow authentication
Use Swagger for API documentation
Flutter: After sign in, the app should show a page where the user can do the following:
Enter his/her weight into a page and submit it
Save this along with the current time
View a list of all weight entries, sorted by most recent date
Bonus features:
Edit an existing weight entry
Delete entries
Sign-out functionality
Notes:
Feel free to use dependency injection libraries such as Provider.

When building the UI and navigating between screens, choose the approach that makes most sense in terms of usability.

Adding unit tests is not required for this project.

If some requirements appear to be vague or lack sufficient details, make assumptions based on your own judgment.

The assignment will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

The app works and satisfies the requirements outlined above
General project structure and organization of code
Separation of concerns between UI, authentication, database code
Implicity - we don't require an over-engineered solution
Naming conventions for variables, functions and classes
Making the UI look nice is not required as part of this task - but is a bonus!

The expected duration of this assignment is between 1 and 4 days ONLY

When submitting the assignment, compress the entire Flutter project into a zip file, and send an email to alex@doshex.com, siya@doshex.com, and fred@doshex.com to notify them of your completion.

Bonus: using GIT, check-in your code to this repositoy with a branch using your name! Ask questions if something is wrong with this process for you

If there are any parts of this assignment that you can not complete, include a brief explanation of why.
